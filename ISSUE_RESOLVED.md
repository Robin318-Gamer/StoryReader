# Issue Resolution: Audio Not Uploading to Supabase

## 🔍 Root Cause Identified

The issue was **NOT** with Supabase configuration or permissions. The problem was that you had **two different API endpoint files**:

### The Problem

1. **`/api/tts.js`** (OLD - No Supabase integration)
   - Only called Google TTS API
   - Returned base64 `audioContent` directly
   - **Did NOT upload to Supabase**
   - **Did NOT return `audioUrl`**

2. **`/pages/api/tts.ts`** (NEW - With Supabase integration)
   - Calls Google TTS API
   - Uploads audio to Supabase Storage
   - Saves to history database
   - Returns `audioUrl`

### What Was Happening

When you deployed to Vercel or ran the dev server, **both endpoints were available**:
- `/api/tts` → served by `/api/tts.js` (OLD)
- `/pages/api/tts` → served by `/pages/api/tts.ts` (NEW)

Your frontend was calling `/api/tts`, which routed to the **old file without Supabase integration**. This is why:
- ✅ Audio generation worked (Google TTS API called successfully)
- ✅ You received audioContent in base64
- ❌ No file was uploaded to Supabase
- ❌ No `audioUrl` was returned
- ❌ Nothing was saved to history

### Evidence from Network Tab

Looking at your browser DevTools screenshot:
```javascript
Response payload: {
  "audioContent": "//NAAAAAAAAAAAAA...", // base64 audio
  "characterCount": 91,
  "speed": "1.0", 
  "voice": "yue-HK-Standard-A"
  // ❌ Missing: audioUrl field!
}
```

The old endpoint was being used, which explains why there was no Supabase upload.

## ✅ Solution Applied

**Removed the old endpoint:**
```bash
rm /workspaces/StoryReader/api/tts.js
rmdir /workspaces/StoryReader/api
```

Now only `/pages/api/tts.ts` exists, which has full Supabase integration.

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Restart your dev server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test the application again:**
   - Generate speech
   - You should now see `audioUrl` in the response
   - Audio should be uploaded to Supabase
   - History should be saved

3. **Verify with the debugging logs:**
   - Check browser console for `[Frontend]` logs
   - Check server logs for `[DEBUG]` messages
   - You should see upload success messages

4. **Redeploy to Vercel** (if needed):
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Remove old API endpoint, use Supabase-integrated version"
   git push
   ```

## 📊 Expected Behavior Now

With only the correct endpoint:

```javascript
// Request
POST /api/tts
{
  "text": "...",
  "voice": "yue-HK-Standard-A",
  "speed": 1.0
}

// Response (NEW - with Supabase)
{
  "audioUrl": "https://xxx.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/audio/tts-audio/...",
  "characterCount": 91,
  "voice": "yue-HK-Standard-A",
  "speed": 1.0,
  "cached": false,
  "version": "2025-10-02T01:00Z",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-02T02:06:00.000Z"
}
```

## 🎯 Key Takeaways

1. **Always check for duplicate endpoints** when APIs aren't behaving as expected
2. **Vercel serves both `/api/*` and `/pages/api/*`** as valid API routes
3. **The debugging code helped identify** that the response format was wrong
4. **Network tab analysis** revealed missing `audioUrl` field

## 🔧 Files Changed

- ❌ Deleted: `/api/tts.js`
- ❌ Deleted: `/api/` directory
- ✅ Kept: `/pages/api/tts.ts` (with full Supabase integration)

## ✨ Result

Your audio should now:
- ✅ Upload to Supabase Storage successfully
- ✅ Return a public `audioUrl`
- ✅ Save to history table
- ✅ Be retrievable from the History page
- ✅ Use caching for duplicate requests

Test it now and you should see it working correctly! 🎉
