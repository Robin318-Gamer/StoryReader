## 📋 Required Context for AI Agents

When starting development, AI agents should review these documents in order:

1. **`docs/APPLICATION_DESIGN.md`** - Architecture, components, data flow, and patterns
2. **`docs/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md`** - Setup, workflows, and tech stack
3. **`docs/API.md`** - Backend endpoint specifications
4. **`docs/TESTING_STRATEGY.md`** - TDD approach and testing requirements
5. **`docs/PROGRESS.md`** - (this file) Current status and next tasks
6. **`.github/copilot-instructions.md`** - React development standards
7. **`README.md`** - Project overview
