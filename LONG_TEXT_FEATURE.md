# Long Text Support - Quick Summary

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. Character Counter ✅
- Real-time character and byte count display
- Color-coded warnings:
  - **Gray** (< 4000 bytes): Normal
  - **Orange** (4000-4999 bytes): Approaching limit
  - **Red** (5000+ bytes): Will be chunked
- Shows estimated number of chunks

### 2. Intelligent Text Chunking ✅
- **Automatically splits text at sentence boundaries** (after . ! ? 。！？)
- Supports both English and Chinese punctuation
- Safe limit of 4500 bytes per chunk (below Google's 5000 limit)
- Falls back to word-level splitting if single sentence is too long

### 3. Automatic Audio Merging ✅
- Processes each chunk through Google TTS API
- Merges all audio chunks into single MP3 file
- Uploads one merged file to Supabase
- Seamless playback experience

### 4. User Feedback ✅
- Warning banner when text exceeds limit
- Success message shows number of chunks processed
- Transparent processing - user doesn't need to do anything

## 📁 New Files

1. `/src/utils/textChunker.ts` - Smart text splitting (respects sentences)
2. `/src/utils/audioMerger.ts` - MP3 audio merging
3. `/docs/LONG_TEXT_SUPPORT.md` - Complete documentation

## 🎯 Modified Files

1. `/pages/api/tts.ts` - Added chunking and merging logic
2. `/pages/index.tsx` - Added character counter and warnings

## 🚀 How to Test

1. **Restart your dev server** (if running):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test with short text** (< 5000 bytes):
   - Should work as before
   - Character counter shows in gray

3. **Test with long text** (> 5000 bytes):
   - Copy a long article or story
   - Warning banner appears
   - Character counter shows in red
   - Click "Generate Speech"
   - See status: "✅ Speech generated successfully! (Processed X chunks and merged)"
   - Audio plays seamlessly as one file

## 🎨 UI Changes

### Before:
```
┌────────────────────────┐
│ Text to Convert        │
│ [                    ] │
└────────────────────────┘
```

### After:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Text to Convert    150 characters | 450 bytes │
│ [                                         ] │
│                                              │
│ ℹ️ Your text exceeds 5000 bytes. It will   │
│ be automatically split into 2 chunks and    │
│ merged into a single audio file.            │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## 💡 Key Features

### Smart Sentence-Based Splitting
```python
Original text: "This is sentence one. This is sentence two. This is sentence three."
                                    ↑                        ↑
                              Chunk breaks here    and/or here
                            (respects punctuation)

Result: Natural-sounding audio with proper pauses
```

### Example Log Output
```
[textChunker] Text exceeds limit: 7500 bytes
[textChunker] Found 15 sentences
[textChunker] Chunk 1: 8 sentences, 4200 bytes
[textChunker] Chunk 2: 7 sentences, 3300 bytes
[TTS API] Processing 2 chunk(s)...
[TTS API] ✓ Chunk 1/2 processed successfully
[TTS API] ✓ Chunk 2/2 processed successfully
[audioMerger] Merging 2 audio chunks
[audioMerger] ✓ Successfully merged
```

## ✨ Benefits

✅ **No Google API errors** - text split before sending to API
✅ **Smart splitting** - cuts at sentence boundaries, not mid-word
✅ **Seamless audio** - user hears one continuous audio file
✅ **Automatic** - no user action needed
✅ **Visual feedback** - clear warnings and status messages
✅ **Full text preserved** - original text saved in history

## 🎉 Ready to Use!

The implementation is complete and ready to test. Just paste in a long article or story (> 5000 bytes) and watch it automatically chunk, process, merge, and play! 🎵
